# Introduction
Oyster Marketing and Design Developer Documentation. This started life off as Google docs and then onto Bitbucket wiki pages but, these always lacked something. Discovered Docusaurus while integrating with a 3rd party API along with a couple of other agencies doing the same thing so here we are.

These Oyster standards are version-independent and "always-current". All new code/builds should follow the current standards, regardless of Drupal core version. Existing code in older versions may be updated, but doesn't necessarily have to be.

## Why ##
Because why not and we thought it would be nice to try something out other than Drupal for once, and share our workflow/ideas/setup. This documentation is build using [https://docusaurus.io/](https://docusaurus.io/), source hosted on [https://github.com](https://github.com) and deployed to [https://www.netlify.com/](https://www.netlify.com/)
